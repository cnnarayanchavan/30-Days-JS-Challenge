//object literal enhancement provides a concise way to create and structure objects. 

//Instead of explicitly specifying properties, you can directly use variable names as keys within an object. 

//For example:

let naam = "Narayana";

let age = 21;

let college = "RMDSSOE";

let colony = "Popular Colony";

let meth1 = ()=> console.log(`hey there this is ${naam} from ${college}`);

const userInfo = {naam,age,college,colony,meth1};

meth1()
